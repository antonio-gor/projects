# Projects

## Astro/Physics

### [Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/antonio-gor/ULAB-Project)

Created a convolutional neural network to detect exoplanets candidates. Created a dataset from raw Kepler Space Telescope data.

## Mathematics

### [Julia Set and Fractals](https://github.com/antonio-gor/Julia-Set-and-Fractals)

> ...the infinite sea of complexity includes two islands: one of Euclidean simplicity, and also a second of relative simplicity in which roughness is present, but is the same at all scales.

Benoît Mandelbrot, [2004](https://www.edge.org/conversation/benoit_mandelbrot-a-theory-of-roughness)

The Mandelbrot set always gets all the attention so here is a small, little program to generate images of the Julia set. This is done by recursively apply the function ![julia_eqn](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c933c9b5913621bd772d71e19a6a6ac00876db1b "Julia equation"). By varying parameters, gifs like the one below can be created.

## Other

### [folder-clock](https://github.com/antonio-gor/folder-clock)

The tiny, stupid folder-clock you never asked for. As someone with an aversion to status bars and docks, I needed a way to see the time without hovering over the edge of the screen to pull up the clock. So, folder-clock it is.
